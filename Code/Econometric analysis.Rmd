## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

#Load the library tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
#Load the library readxl
library(readxl)

#Load the Master_data
Master_data = read_excel("Master_data.xlsx")

#Keep the relevant variables
Master_data = Master_data %>% 
  select("County_State_Year", "County", "State", "Year", "Foreign_born", "Female", "Associate_degree", "Bachelor_degree", "Graduate_or_professional_degree", "Rural", "Vote_share_difference") 
  
  

```



```{r}
#Before going forward with our analysis, I am going to see the correlation matrix in order to stay away from any possible multicollinearity.

#In order to check the correlation amtrix we change the variable Rural to numeric. Then we will convert it back to factor again. Change the Rural varibale to factor
Master_data= Master_data %>% 
  mutate(Rural= as.numeric(Rural))

# Exclude the specified columns (Because they are either characters or factor)
selected_columns = setdiff(names(Master_data), c("State", "County", "Year", "County_State_Year"))

#Load the library "Hmisc"
library("Hmisc")

# Find the correlation coefficient matrix
mydata.rcorr = rcorr(as.matrix(Master_data[, selected_columns]))
#Print the correlation matrix
mydata.rcorr


#Based on the correlation matrix we see that neither any variable has high correlation with other variables, except, Bachelor degree and Graduate_or_professional_degree (Correlation coefficient= 0.81). However, we believe that including both Bachelor degree and Graduate_and_professional_degree is important because it may help better explain our model and they really matter. So, we do  not drop any variable.

#We now again convert Rural to factor
Master_data= Master_data %>% 
  mutate(Rural= as.numeric(Rural))


```


```{r}
#Load the library plm
library(plm)


# Create a panel data frame
pdata = pdata.frame(Master_data, index = c("State", "County", "Year"))

# Fit the fixed effects model
model = plm(Vote_share_difference ~ Foreign_born + Associate_degree + Bachelor_degree + Graduate_or_professional_degree + Rural + Female, data = pdata, model = "within")

# Print the summary of the fixed effects model
summary(model)


# Subset the data to include only rural observations
rural_data <- subset(pdata, Rural == 1)

# Fit the fixed effects model on the rural subset
model2 <- plm(Vote_share_difference ~ Foreign_born + Associate_degree + Bachelor_degree + Graduate_or_professional_degree + Female, data = rural_data, model = "within")

#Print the model2
summary(model2)



# Subset the data to include only urban observations
urban_data <- subset(pdata, Rural == 0)

# Fit the fixed effects model on the rural subset
model3 <- plm(Vote_share_difference ~ Foreign_born + Associate_degree + Bachelor_degree + Graduate_or_professional_degree + Female, data = urban_data, model = "within")

#Print the model3
